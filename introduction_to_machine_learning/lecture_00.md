yapping about the course

Interesting books on the slides.

## Machine learning

AI is the discipline. Deep learning is a subject of the discipline

Machine learning idea: the program is written by the machine not the contrary.

Data is crucial. You have to prepare the data very carefully.

We create a model which represents knowledge. The model is used on future data.

New thing: model customization, ex is chatgpt

No need to put machine learning everywhere

more yapping. still introductory.

## Deep learning

A lot of layers deeply interconnected

each layer compute a different stage. example: faces. they star very abstract and then become more defined as you progress trough the network.
