## Data

- Acquisition
- Preprocessing
- Dimensionality reduction
  - filtering for only interesting features
 
## Learning

- Model learning
- Model testing
  - using different data
 
Iteration is key

Information gap when extracting features from the data

## Types of learning

### Supervised
- Classification 
  - finite set of labels 
  - Face recognition
- Regression
  - label is real-valued
  - predict value of a stock
- Ranking
  - label is ranking
  - web pages ranking

Recap:
- Classification:
  - Classification categorizes input data into predefined classes or
  categories.
- Regression:
  - Regression predicts continuous numerical values based on input
  features.
- Ranking:
  - Ranking orders a set of items based on their relevance or preference.
 
### Unsupervised

- Clustering
  - Social newtwork analysis 
  - Anomaly detection. find the outlier
- dimensionality reduction
  -  mapping data into another low dimensional space 

Recap:
- Clustering
  - Clustering groups similar data points into clusters or groups
    based on their inherent characteristics or features.
- Dimensionality Reduction
  - Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of input variables
    or features in a dataset while preserving the most important
    information.
